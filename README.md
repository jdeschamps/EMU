# What is EMU?

Easier Micro-manager User interface (EMU) is a [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager) plugin that loads easily reconfigurable user interfaces. By using EMU classes, the UI controlling your devices is easily configurable and transferable, no need to hard-code the name of your devices and recompile the interface every time something changes on the microscope. Any user can quickly and intuitively configure and adjust parameters of the interface.
